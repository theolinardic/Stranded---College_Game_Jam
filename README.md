[*Stranded*](https://ionpowered.itch.io/stranded) is a narrative puzzle game created in seven days as part of the [*College Game Jam*](https://itch.io/jam/college-game-jam). In the game you play as a man who is stranded on an island after a plane crash and attempts to use salvaged resources to make a radio and contact the outside world. 


Stranded was made in the Unity Engine using C# by myself and one other person. I was in charge of creating the main mechanics for interacting with objects, unscrewing and disassembling components, the radio tuning mini game, and some light cutscene work.


You can see some GIFs of gameplay sections I was responsible for below, watch a [full playthrough on YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk_821SzzM0) (6 minutes long), or [download the game and play it yourself here](https://ionpowered.itch.io/stranded).
